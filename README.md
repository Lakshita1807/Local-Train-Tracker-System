**Live Local Train Tracking Interface**


**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**  

In metropolitan cities like Mumbai, local trains are the primary mode of transportation for millions of commuters. However, passengers often face uncertainty regarding the real-time location, arrival time, delays, or cancellations of Local trains. This project aims to develop a Live Local Train Tracking Interface that provides real-time updates about train movements between stations.

**DESCRIPTION**

Live Local Train Tracking Interface provides real-time updates regarding Mumbai locals. In our paper, we focus on generating our own custom dataset using AI-based data generation tools for more realistic train schedules, delay patterns, and travel times between stations. Using the dataset , our system powers accurate dynamic and user-friendly train tracking information that reduces uncertainty for millions of daily commuters and provide them easy to access local train tracker which would give them updates in seconds such as its real-time location,arrival time,status etc.

**Tech Stack**
